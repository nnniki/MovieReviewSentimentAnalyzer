# Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer üé•üéûÔ∏è

This is a project made by me for Modern Java Technologies course in Faculty Of Matematics and Informatics at Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski

- *Sentiment Analysis* is the process of algorithmically identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in free text, especially to determine whether the author's attitude toward a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative or neutral.
- In this project i am implementing *sentiment analyzer* for movie reviews, which will automatically determine the level of positivity of a given review in free text. This will be really useful next time we are trying to find a well-reviewed movie on Sunday night. üçø

- For example:

    *"Dire disappointment: dull and unamusing freakshow"*   -  This type of review will be classified as strongly negative.

    *"Immersive ecstasy: energizing artwork!"*  -  This type of review will be classified as firmly positive.

I will use a scale from 0 to 4 to classify a user's review as following:
| rating  | meaning           |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 0       | negative          |
| 1       | somewhat negative |
| 2       | neutral           |
| 3       | somewhat positive |
| 4       | positive          |

- I am using a data set from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), which you can find here: [movieReviews.txt](https://github.com/nnniki/MovieReviewSentimentAnalyzer/blob/main/resources/movieReviews.txt)
- There are a set of specific words, called *stopwords*, which don't give any semanthics at all, such as: pronouns, unions, prepositions and so on. This type of words will be ignored during text analyzation. You can find the set of
  stopwords i am using here: [stopwords.txt](https://github.com/nnniki/MovieReviewSentimentAnalyzer/blob/main/resources/stopwords.txt)

- The main functionalities are presented in ```SentimentAnalyzer``` interface
